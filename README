Alexa Shorthorn News

We would like to make it easier for students to keep up with daily UTA campus news and 
events via a new Amazon Echo custom skill.

We chose this project to help students keep track of the current news without the hassle
of having to pull up the Shorthorn website or read the paper. It's a hands-free method
of keeping up to date with current events.

This is a Alexa news skill that can read the UTA Shorthorn News. It can read teh Sports, 
Opinion, Life & Entertainment, and just default news. Also, it has the ability to read the 
name, time, and location of the current daily events that are happening on campus.
